# IEP Arduino Project

Welcome to the **IEP Arduino Project** repository!  
This is a C++ project developed as part of the *Integrated Electronics Project (IEP)* lab for a graded assessment at Singapore Polytechnic.

## Overview

This project demonstrates practical applications of C++ programming and Arduino hardware integration. It is designed to fulfill the requirements of the IEP lab assessment, focusing on both software development and hardware interfacing skills.

## Features

- C++ implementation for Arduino microcontrollers
- Modular code structure for easy understanding and modification
- Demonstrates essential electronics and programming concepts covered in IEP

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Arduino IDE (download from [official site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
   - Compatible Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
   - Basic electronic components as specified in your lab instructions

2. **Setup**
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Reymarch995/IEPArdruinoProject.git
     ```
   - Open the project files using Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your Arduino board via USB.

3. **Upload & Test**
   - Select the correct board and port in the IDE.
   - Upload the code to your Arduino.
   - Follow your lab worksheet for circuit setup and expected results.
